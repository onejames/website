          Over the last 15 years or so a lot of aquariums have come in and out of the house. About 6 years ago a breakout of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyophthirius_multifiliis">Ick</a> attacked our freshwater tanks and about the same time I had unknowingly added a brass piece to an anerobic digester and wiped out my saltwater tank. We moved a few months afterwards, and have not set up a tank since. Having my office in the dark basement has reciently caused me to setup my favorite tank, as a piecefull community planted tank.

      <p class="catchyParagraph" >
          The primary tank is a 30 gallon long tank, otherwise known as a "30 breeder". This is my favorite size of aquarium. 30 gallions is a good size for a few fish, and the longer tank gives more serface area for gas exchange and distance for the fish to swim. This is all assuming you are not planning on getting tall fish, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterophyllum">angelfish</a>.

          This tank is planted with several tyoes of plants, including

          The idea behind the fish in the tank is 2 fold, one - I wanted small schooling fish that would be visually apealing from a distance, and two - I need to fill the nitches in the tank where nutrients are present. Currently the fish include:

      <p class="subtitle">The sump</p>
      <div class="sexyLine" ></div>

      <p class="catchyParagraph">
          While sumps are fequently relagated to saltwater tanks, they are an execlant way to build any clutter-free aquarium - allowing great filtering, stable water levels, ease of replacing or adding filters or bio media.
          Sumps can be configured as a mechanical filter, a storage area with approprate flow for for bio media, or to include a refugium - I have tried to include a bit of each.
          <img src="static/projectImages/aquarium/sump.jpg" />
      </p>

      <p class="quietLinks">
        This sump can be broken into three primary sections, the <a href="#sumpIntake">intake</a>, <a href="#sumpRefugium">refugium</a>, and <a href="#sumpReturn">return</a>. A transition section exists between each section that directs flow and maintain minimal water levels in each section, as well as house filter media.
        Beyond the functionality of each compartment with sump design you need to consider a few overall parameters and how they impact the size and design of each componennt.
      </p>
      <h3>Capacity</h3>
      <p>
        How large is your sump going to be? In aquariums the more water you have the more stable your entire system is going to be, but not everyone wants a monster tank. Adding a sump is a great way to increase the over all volume of your tank with out needing to invest in a larger aquarium. Consider what is practical here, and think about using some alternative containers when asthetics are not a concern.
      </p>
      <h3>Flow</h3>
      <p>
        In order for the sump to be effective water needs to move through it. As a rule of thumb the total volume of the display taks should cycle through the sump no less than 4 times per hour (up to 15 or so). Because this is a freshwater tank I can be prety concertivative with my flow rates. I have about 37 gallons of water in my system, so I should be looking for a pump that will move ~150+ GPH, as well as considering what ever flow I actually have out of the pump will flow through the sump's cavities, over sand, and through filter media. Making these spaces to small with result in section overflows, bad performance, and messes.
      </p>
      <h3>Drian</h3>
      <p style="overflow: visable;">
        At some point the water that is being pumped into the aquarium needs to run back into the sump. This is normally controlled with an <a class="imageHover indicateToolTip">overflow</a>. I wont go into great deatil on these, as they are covered extensively other places.
      </p>
      <h3>Functionality</h3>
      <p>
        What is the point of the sump in the tank? Are you simply adding volume to your system, or do you need a space for creatures that would otherwise be eaten? In my case I need an area to store biomedia, a good section to filter out fine to corse particulates, and an area to try and furter process nitrates and other setteled debrie. I also am a nerd and what to see what is going on, so a glass 10 gallion aquarium is my coice of vessle.
      </p>
      <div id="sumpIntake" class="quietLinks wrapper">
          <img src="static/projectImages/aquarium/sumpIn.jpg" style="float: left; max-height: 500px; margin: 10px;" />
          <p style="padding: 100px 50px;">
              The intake recieves the water from the tank's overflow. This also houses my assortment of loose biomedia. I found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:512825">this bio ball</a> and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3095445">this bio cube</a> on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">thingaverse</a> and printed several of them to see how PLA stands up to the aquarium in the logn run. On top I used some loose hydroponics media <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hydroton-Original-Clay-Pebbles-Lightweight/dp/B01KYYZDUS/ref=sr_1_11">hydroton</a>. Most of this floats ontop and recieves a lot of airation from the intake causing <span class="tinyNote">(what I feel and have nothing to back up)</span> a great enviroment for bacteria. The transition here has some loose floss to keep the bio media in its section.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sumpRefugium" class="quietLinks wrapper">
          <p style="float: left; max-width: 31%; padding: 100px 2px;">
              The center portion of the sump acts as both a refugium and a place for suspended solids to settle out.
          </p>
          <img src="static/projectImages/aquarium/sumpRefugium.jpg" style="float: left; max-width: 31%;" />
          <p style="float: left; max-width: 31%; padding: 100px 2px;">
               Having thse two ideas combined gives an oppertunity to employ some scavangers to help further break down any waste. I house a few ghost shrimp and a bunch of babby tears here for just that reason.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sumpReturn" class="quietLinks wrapper">
          <img src="static/projectImages/aquarium/sumpOut.jpg" style="float: right; max-width: 33%;" />
          <p>
              <br/><br/><br/>
              Entering into the return these baffolds contain the finer filter media. Currently there is more free floating algie than I would like to see and I have installed some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HHM0TA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s02">water polishing pads</a> to filter out finer particals. Normally I would have some less restrictive filter floss. The return houses the pump and any additional additives that I wanted on the 'clean' side of the sump. These include some standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/API-AMMO-CARB-Aquarium-Filtration-40-Ounce/dp/B000255NFA/ref=sr_1_1">ammocarb</a> that is a bit past due, as well as a few baggs of the afformentioned hydroton. The constant movement in this section rotates and tumbles thees bags in much the same way that a biowheel would function in a <span class="indicateToolTip" title="Hang On Back">HOB</span> filter.
